## K8s - Imperative vs Declarative programming
In the context of Kubernetes, imperative and declarative are two different paradigms used to define and manage the desired state of resources within a cluster. While imperative commands are useful for ad-hoc tasks or interactive exploration, the declarative approach is more suitable for managing and maintaining resources in a Kubernetes cluster efficiently. Let's explore each approach! But first, we need a tool to interact with our cluster.

### Kubectl
The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) command-line tool is a powerful utility provided by Kubernetes that allows you to interact with and manage Kubernetes clusters. Use the following syntax to run kubectl commands from your terminal window:

```bash
kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

Where:
* **command:** Specifies the operation you want to perform on one or more Kubernetes resources. Some commonly used commands include `create`, `get`, `describe`, `delete`, `apply`, and `scale`. Each command has its own set of options and subcommands.
* **TYPE:** Indicates the type of Kubernetes resource you want to interact with. It can be a single resource type like `Pod, Deployment, Service`, or a more general term like `all`, `nodes`, `namespaces`, etc.
* **NAME:** Specifies the name of the specific resource you want to operate on.
* **flags:** These are optional flags that modify the behavior of the command. Flags can be used to specify additional parameters, control output formats, apply labels, set resource limits, etc. Flags are specific to each command and can be listed by running `kubectl [command] --help`.

 To activate Docker Desktop Kubernetes, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Install Docker Desktop: If you haven't already, download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system from the official Docker website. Ensure that you have administrative privileges to install software on your machine.</li>
  <li>Enable Kubernetes: Once Docker Desktop is installed, launch the application. Depending on your operating system, you may find the Docker Desktop icon in your system tray or application launcher. Open the Docker Desktop settings.</li>
  <li>Go to Kubernetes Settings: In the Docker Desktop settings, navigate to the "Kubernetes" tab. Here, you'll find options related to Kubernetes configuration.</li>
  <li>Enable Kubernetes: Enable the Kubernetes checkbox to activate Kubernetes support in Docker Desktop. This will start the process of setting up and enabling Kubernetes on your local machine.</li>
  <li>Wait for Setup: Docker Desktop will initiate the setup process for Kubernetes, which may take a few moments. It will automatically download the required components and set up the Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.</li>
  <li>Verify Kubernetes Status: Once the setup is complete, you can verify the status of Kubernetes by checking the Docker Desktop interface. The status indicator will change to "Running" or "Enabled" to indicate that Kubernetes is active.</li>
  <li>Access Kubernetes Cluster: Docker Desktop automatically configures the <code>kubectl</code> command-line tool to interact with the local Kubernetes cluster. To access the Kubernetes cluster, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that <code>kubectl</code> is correctly configured and connected to the local cluster:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>kubectl version
</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully activated Docker Desktop Kubernetes. You can now use Kubernetes to deploy and manage containerized applications on your local machine. Remember to familiarize yourself with Kubernetes concepts and commands to make the most of its capabilities.</p>

### Imperative Approach
In the imperative approach, you specify the exact sequence of commands or actions to be performed to create or modify Kubernetes resources. You interact with the Kubernetes API by issuing explicit instructions.

Letâ€™s first create a node running Nginx by using the imperative way.

##### Create the pod using the Imperative way
```bash
kubectl run mynginx --image=nginx
```

##### Get a list of pods and their status
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
> ## Output
> The status of the pod is "ContainerCreating," which means that Kubernetes is currently in the process of creating the container for the pod. The "0/1" under the "READY" column indicates that the pod has not yet reached a ready state. 
> ~~~
> NAME      READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
> mynginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s
> ~~~
> {: .language-output}
> 
> Once the pod is successfully created and the container is running, the status will change to "Running" or a similar value, and the "READY" column will reflect that the pod is ready.
> ~~~
> NAME      READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
> mynginx   1/1     Running             0          70s
> ~~~
> {: .language-output}
{: .solution}

##### Get more info
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
> ## Output
> The updated output indicates that the pod named "mynginx" is now successfully running and ready to serve requests.
> ~~~
> NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP             NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
> mynginx   1/1     Running   0          4m23s   10.244.0.122   minikube   <none>           <none>

```bash
kubectl describe pod mynginx
```
> ## Output
> The status of the pod is "ContainerCreating," which means that Kubernetes is currently in the process of creating the container for the pod. The "0/1" under the "READY" column indicates that the pod has not yet reached a ready state.

##### Delete the pod
```bash
kubectl delete pod mynginx
```

### Declarative Approach
In the declarative approach, you define the desired state of Kubernetes resources in a declarative configuration file (e.g., **YAML** or JSON). Rather than specifying the steps to achieve that state, you describe the desired outcome and let Kubernetes handle the internal details.

##### Create a pod using the declarative way
Download the file:
```bash
wget https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2023-lesson-introcloud/files/kubectl/myapp.yaml
```

> ## YAML File
> This YAML file describes a Pod with an nginx web server container that listens on port 80 and has an environment variable set. 
> The specific behavior and functionality of the nginx web server will depend on the configuration of the nginx image used. 
> ~~~
> # myapp.yaml
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: Pod
> metadata:
>   name: myapp-pod
> spec:
>   containers:
>   - name: nginx-container
>     image: nginx
>     ports:
>     - containerPort: 80
>     env:
>     - name: DBCON
>       value: myconnectionstring
> ~~~
> {: .language-yaml}
{: .solution}

Now, letâ€™s create a pod using the YAML file
```bash
kubectl create -f myapp.yaml
```

Get some info
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod myapp-pod
```

Open a shell in the running pod
```bash
kubectl exec -it myapp-pod -- bash
```
> ## Output
> We used the command to execute an interactive shell session within the "myapp-pod" pod. After executing this command, you are now inside the pod and running commands as the "root" user. The prompt "root@myapp-pod:/#" indicates that you are currently in the pod's shell environment and can run commands.
> ~~~
> root@myapp-pod:/#
> ~~~
> {: .language-output}
{: .solution}

Print the DBCON environment variable that was set in the YAML file.
```bash
echo $DBCON
```
> ## Output
> The command "echo $DBCON" is used to print the value of the environment variable "DBCON".
> ~~~
> root@myapp-pod:/# echo $DBCON
> myconnectionstring
> ~~~
> {: .language-output}
{: .solution}

Exit from the container
```bash
exit
```

Delete the pod
```bash
kubectl delete -f myapp.yaml
```

The declarative approach is the recommended way to manage resources in Kubernetes. It promotes consistency, reproducibility, and automation. You can easily version control the configuration files, track changes over time, and collaborate with team members more effectively.

## Let's run a few examples.

[Kubernetes namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) partition resources in a cluster, creating isolated virtual clusters. They allow multiple teams or applications to coexist while maintaining separation and preventing conflicts. 
#### Get the currently configured namespaces:
```bash
kubectl get namespaces
kubectl get ns
```
Both commands are equivalent and will retrieve the list of namespaces in your Kubernetes cluster. 

#### Get the pods list:
Get a list of all the installed pods.
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
You get the pods from the default namespace. Try getting the pods from the docker namespace. You will get a different list.
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
  
> ## Output
> The command "kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system" is used to retrieve information about the pods running in the "kube-system" namespace. 
> ~~~
> NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE

#### Get nodes information:
Get a list of all the installed nodes. Using Docker Desktop or Minikube, there should be only one.
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Get some info about the node.
```bash
kubectl describe node
```
> ## Output
> The output provides details about each node, including its name, status, roles, age, and version.
> ~~~

### Run your first deployment
A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) is a higher-level resource that provides declarative updates and manages the deployment of Pods. It allows you to define the desired state of your application, including the number of replicas, container images, and resource requirements.

These pods are controlled by the ReplicaSet "deploy-example-54fbc9897" and are running the "nginx:alpine" image. They have successfully pulled the image, created the container, and started running. Each pod has an IP assigned, and they are running on the "minikube" node.

#### Get the ReplicaSet name:
A ReplicaSet is a lower-level resource that ensures a specified number of replicas of a Pod are running at all times.
```bash
kubectl get rs

> ## Output
>  The current replica count matches the desired count, indicating that the ReplicaSet has successfully created and maintained 3 replicas. All 3 replicas are ready and available.

{: .solution}

In summary, a Deployment provides a higher-level abstraction for managing and updating the desired state of Pods, while a ReplicaSet is a lower-level resource that ensures the specified number of Pod replicas are maintained. Deployments use ReplicaSets under the hood to achieve the desired state and handle scaling and rolling updates.

#### Cleanup
Delete the pod
```bash
kubectl delete -f deploy-example.yaml
