## Cleaning workspace

Remember to delete your workflows:
Run this until you get a message indicating there is no more workflows.

```bash
argo delete -n argo @latest
```

## Cleaning resources

Deleting the argo namespace will delete all the resources created in this pre-exercise:

```bash
kubectl delete ns argo
```

> ## Minikube - Stop your cluster
> 
> From a terminal with administrator access (but not logged in as root), run:
> ```bash
> minikube stop
> ```
